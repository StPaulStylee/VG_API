# VG API
This is my second take on a video game database search application that uses an API built by Giant Bomb. It will be built using Go for the backend, MySQL for the data store, and Angular 5 for the client side. I intend to make this version much more verbose. Additions will include user authenticity, user profile pages, links to available games and game related items on Amazon, and links to Redbox rental availability (that assumes they have an API, that is yet to actually be determined!!). It is likely I will make a scaled down version of the application available for view once I get to that point. I aim to have that up by April 15th, 2018.  As the app grows, I will refine this document - currently it is a simple explanation of my intentions. NOW LETS BUILD THIS THING!
